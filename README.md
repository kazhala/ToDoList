This is a personal project built with the purpose of learning React.js basics. 

In master branch, code contains basic version of todo list, which let user add/complete/remove todos, view completed todos, and search for todos. 

In redux-learn branch, the project has the same functionality of master branch, but all states are handled through redux.

The redux-learn verison of this app is delopyed through surge. You could try this app online at http://kaztodolist.surge.sh/.

If you would like to play around the code locally, first clone the branch and run "npm install" on the command line, then start the application using "npm start" at the command line.

Enjoy :)
